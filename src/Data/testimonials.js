    test: "Experience with Draic is not something that can be expressed in few words. Because it has given not only knowledge but also memories and most importantly a family. Starting from the first day of the recruitment test to the interview and then getting selected in team was very unexpected. Because I thought I won't get selected. But still they selected me. And I am really thankful to all. Experience with juniors also was great. One of the best people I have ever met.",

    test: "DRAIC's journey commenced in my 2nd year. I was selected amongst the few. But, something held on and the year of first IIT Delhi Robocon came to end with a bitterness of failure and sweetness of making a 3D printer from scratch. The leadership changed from Tanmay and Siddhesh bhaiya to Gaurav bhaiya, which in turn brought DRAIC into existence. It was a time to become a senior. As we entered the pandemic, we had a 3D printer and AIR 4 in our bags of achievements!! The virtual world gave the programming head , a talented Jr. team an understanding cabinet of SAYDRSS, not the best but we were awesome. We Came, Achieved and Laughed together. That's how a journey of 3 years ended virtually.",

The team helped me a lot in my personal and technical development, the team was there with me in all my highs and lows. The time that I have spent here is very precious.  Each project, competition, event, dinner, chai break, every moment with the team is worth cherishing. The DRAIC made me realize that,You don't build the TEAM, The Team builds YOU",

    test: "I joined DRC in my 2nd Year just hoping to learn something other than academics and that turned out to be the best decision of my engineering. Our team participated in Robocon making an automated Disk throwing Robot, a Four-legged Robot, and also making a 3D Printer which was yet another interesting project to work on. Participating in different college and National level Robotics competitions, Organizing events, workshops, and making robots all year round. It‚Äôs amazing working with 30 people of different streams and learning about other streams as well. Working with DRC was like being part of a family, I‚Äôve been part of this family for good three years and was fortunate enough to lead the team for a year.",

    test: " I've been part of the club from my second year of Engineering, I was always found in college workshop rather than department. I've not only learnt technical stuffs in the club but also grown up as a better human, right from time management, discipline, public speaking to team playing. Conducting and organizing events, seminars and participating in many competition along with team have given alot of experience to me. Many a times it was difficult to manage academics and club together, but with the most supportive team everything was simple. I would always cherish the time spent at the club.",

    test: "Joining DRC was one of my best decisions in my life. Like any other person, I used to think robotics as something a high tech thing and feared it. I was selected as an external member. But due to my dedication I was included in the core team the same year.I used to spend most of my time at DRC. Participating in National level Robotics competitions and an opportunity to represent India at International level gave us the chills.I feel very proud to be selected as a part of this small team that became a family. We organized Events, Workshops and participated in different college level competitions as well.I consider myself lucky to be a part of such a wonderful family.",

    test: "my best memory: staying up all night at the workshop.my regret: Could've done a lot more for the team and for myself.DRAIC is the best moment of my life at college. I met some people who will always be on my 'list_of_people_I_never_want_to_forget.txt', people who taught me patience, politeness, humbleness, forgiveness. I saw what hard work really looks like, I also saw what true dedication looks like and whenever I will think of those people, I will think about all those qualities they have and I try to carry them through in my own life. and so I want to thank all those people, You know who you are! Thank you so much team DRAIC (2018‚Äì21), wishing you all the best for the future.",
